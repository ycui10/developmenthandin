      <p>
       For this assignment, I built a lip product shopping website that allows users to filter on the type and the brand of lip products
       they would like to shop for. Users could sort the list of the lip products presented to them by price. They could add and remove lip
       products to their shopping cart, and a total of price in the shopping cart will be calculated for them.
      </p>

    <h5>
      Usability Principles 
    </h5>
</div>

<div class = "row" >
  <p>
   In order to keep users informed of what is going on, I use different text colors to indicate the tag/category they are currently 
   choosing in the filter section. The one that is selected by users is in color of black, and the other categories that are not
   selected are in color of blue. I set the unselected categories in blue to remind users that those categories are also clickable.
   For example, in the picture below, the category "all" under Type and "Armani Beauty" under Brand are selected.
